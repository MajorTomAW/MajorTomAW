<summary> Camera </summary>

>### 50 Game Camera Mistakes:
>1: Using a dynamic camera when another approach would work.   
>2: Designing levels and camera behaviors that don't match.  
>3: Using global coordinates or quaternions to persist camera state.   
>4: Using a default camera distance that's likely to break line-of-sight.   
>5: Allowing obstacles to break line-of-sight from the side.  
>6: Pushing the camera away from an obstacle while the player is trying to swing the camera towards it.  
>7: Letting the player push the camera inside an obstacle.  
>8: Letting independent forces compete to push the camera.  
>9: Excessively moving the camera to prevent unimportant items from breaking line-of-sight.  
>10: Letting the camera intersect narrow columns.  
>11: Interpreting a hill as a wall to be avoided.  
>12: Swinging the camera sideways when occluders come from behind.  
>13: Letting the camera's near-clipping-plane intersect the avatar.  
>14: Using the same camera distance for all angles.  
>15: Using the same field-of-view for worm's eye angles and standard angles.  
>16: Shifting pitch, distance, and field-of-view independently.  
>17: Not cutting when the avatar passes through opaque objects.  
>18: Letting cuts remap directional controls.  
>19: Breaking the player's sense of direction.  
>20: Violating the 180 degree rule.  
>21: Focusing only on the avatar.  
>22: Relying on players to control the camera all the time.  
>23: Leaving the camera yaw alone while the player is running.  
>24: Making it hard to judge distances,  
>25: Looking straight ahead as the avatar approaches a cliff.  
>26: Keeping the camera level when the avatar is running on a slope.  
>27: Misusing the "Rule of thirds".  
>28: Using the same logic for ground and air motion.  
>29: Relying entirely on procedural camera behaviors.  
>30: Letting players make themselves lost and confused.  
>31: Rotating excessively to look at nearby targets.  
>32: Translating to look at distance targets.  
>33: Letting the avatar's own body occlude targets ahead.  
>34: Giving the player control over the camera, and then taking it away.  
>35: Immediately applying a camera hint after the player finished turning the camera to look at something.  
>36: Not letting experts explore.  
>37: Not providing inverted controls.  
>38: Responding to accidental controller input.  
>39: Using linear sensitivity.  
>40: Letting the camera pivot drift too far.  
>41: Using a too small field-of-view.  
>42: Rapidly shifting field-of-view.  
>43: Excessively shaking the camera.  
>44: Bouncing the camera with the avatar's walk cycle.  
>45: Translating or rotating up and down when the avatar jumps.  
>46: Rapidly transitioning to a new camera position.  
>47: Maintaining pitch speed until hitting the pitch limit.  
>48: Developing for the Oculus Rift as the primary camera method.  
>49: Testing with a narrow demographic.  
>50: Writing a general "constraint solver" that optimizes for the camera.
